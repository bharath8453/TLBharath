This repository contains work completed during my Cloud and DevOps Associate internship (2 months) in the TelecoLearn. It covers hands-on implementations of cloud architecture, containerization (Docker), infrastructure as code (Terraform), and CI/CD automation tailored for telecom network and service management systems.
